+ Is equivalent to *row in in relational database

+ *_id
  - Each document has a special key _id
  
+ A document contains,
  - Ordered set of keys with associated values
  - Ex: {"greeting" : "Hello, world!", "views" : 3}
  - Key
    . Is always a String
    . Any UTF-8 character is allowed except; \0(null) || . || $
  - Value
    . Can be of different data type
    
+ Document is 
  - Type sensitive 
    {"count" : 5}
    {"count" : "5"}
    . The above 2 documents are distinct because of different type
  - Case sensitive
    {"count" : 5}
    {"Count" : 5}
    . The above 2 documents are distinct because of different case              

+ Duplicate keys are not allowed
  Ex: {"greeting" : "Hello, world!", "greeting" : "Hello, MongoDB!"}     
  
= Key value pairs(Fields) are ordered
  Ex: {"x" : 1, "y" : 2} is not the same as {"y" : 2, "x" : 1}
  **Note
    - Do not design application that depends on field order. MongoDB may reorder the fields
    - In some programming languages, the default representation do not event maintain ordering
      . Ex: 
        ` Python - Dictionary
        ` Perl   - Hashes
